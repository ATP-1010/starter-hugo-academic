I'm an undergraduate student from Wuhan University, School of Cyber Science and Engineering. My research interests include AI security, data privacy and especially the robustness of deep learning model and data. I'm working as a research intern in Prof. Qian Wang's NIS&P Lab in Wuhan University.

Previously, I was a research intern at the Pennsylvania State University, advised by Prof. Dongwon Lee and Dr. Thai Le.
